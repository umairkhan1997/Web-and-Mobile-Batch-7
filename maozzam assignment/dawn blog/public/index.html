    <h2 id="Italy">Italy reports 336 coronavirus deaths, 10,386 new cases</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="paraP">Italy has reported 336 coronavirus-related deaths against 258 the day before, the health ministry said, while the daily tally of new infections rose to 10,386 from 7,351 the day before.</p>
    <p class="paraP">
        Some 274,019 tests for Covid-19 were carried out in the past day, compared with a previous 179,278, the health ministry said.
    </p>
    <p class="paraP">
        According to Reuters, Italy has registered 94,171 deaths linked to Covid-19 since its outbreak emerged in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the seventh-highest in the world. The country has reported 2.74 million cases to date.

    <h2 id="Johnson">Johnson & Johnson files for EU vaccine approval</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="paraP">US pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson has applied for authorisation for its coronavirus vaccine in the EU with a decision possible by the middle of March, Europe's drugs regulator.</p>
    <p class="paraP">
        The single-shot vaccine would be the fourth jab to be approved for use across the 27-nation European Union if it gets the green light from the Amsterdam-based European Medicines Agency.
    </p>
    <p class="paraP">
        “EMA has received an application for conditional marketing authorisation for a Covid-19 vaccine developed by Janssen-Cilag International”, J&J's European subsidiary, the watchdog said.    </p>
        <p class="paraP">
            AFP reported that the regulator “could issue an opinion by the middle of March 2021, provided the company's data on the vaccine's efficacy, safety and quality are sufficiently comprehensive and robust”.

    <h2 id="dutch">Dutch PM says curfew needed despite legal order to drop it</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="paraP">Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has called on the country to respect a night-time curfew, saying it was still needed to fight the pandemic despite a court ruling earlier that the measure lacked a legal basis.</p>
    <p class="paraP">
        Rutte maintained that the curfew was needed to prevent a surge of infections due to more contagious new mutations of the virus, and said he would do everything he could to keep it in place.
    </p>
    <p class="paraP">
        “It would be very unwise to lift the curfew at this moment,” Rutte told reporters. “We installed it in order to control the coronavirus as much as possible and to make it possible to regain our freedom in a safe way.”</p>
